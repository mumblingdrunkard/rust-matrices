# Experimenting with matrices in Rust

Doing advent of code 2021, I realized there are some problems that are nicely
expressed as matrix arithmetic. I also realized that there isn't good support
for matrices in Rust.

This is just experimenting with iterators and math. I wouldn't recommend using
it for anything and I'm pretty sure the column iterator is unsound, but I don't
know how to make it sound yet.

Perhaps some day Rust will have first class math syntax. I doubt it though.
